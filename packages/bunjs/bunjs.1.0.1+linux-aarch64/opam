synopsis: "Incredibly fast JavaScript runtime, bundler, test runner, and package all in one"
description: """
Bun (https://bun.sh) is an all-in-one toolkit for JavaScript and TypeScript apps.
It ships as a single executable called bunâ€‹.

At its core is the Bun runtime, a fast JavaScript runtime designed as a drop-in replacement for Node.js.
It's written in Zig and powered by JavaScriptCore under the hood,
dramatically reducing startup times and memory usage.
